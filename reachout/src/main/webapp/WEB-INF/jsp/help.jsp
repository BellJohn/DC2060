						<h3>What is the purpose of a Request?</h3>
						<p>A request is essentially where a single user has a specific need for help. For example, if you needed someone to pick up medication from your local
							pharmacy as you are self-isolating and cannot leave the house, then you would create a request with information about the task. Other people using
							ReachOut would then be able to see this request on the Requests page, where they can then message you for further information or accept the request
							and complete the task for you.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h3>What is the purpose of a Service?</h3>
						<p>A service, or service offer, is where a healthy and able person has a specific task that they are willing to complete for other people. For example,
							if you had a ride on lawn mower and are willing to go around cutting other peoples lawns, then you should raise a service offer with the details.
							Other people will then be able to see this offer on the Services page, and can then message you or accept the service offer, which you can then
							complete for them.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h3>What's the difference between a Request and a Service?</h3>
						<p>A request is raised by someone that needs help, whereas a service is raised by someone that is offering help to others. Please see What is the 
							purpose of a Request? and What is the purpose of a Service? for further specific information.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h3>How do I send a message?</h3>
						<p>When you view more details of a Request or Service, you are able to message the user who posted it. You can view messages you have sent in the 
							<i>My Messages</i> section. This is your personal message page where you are also able to reply to any individuals who have seen your Request or Service 
							and messaged you.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-12">
						<h3>How do I update my status?</h3>
