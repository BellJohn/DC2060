                        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Posted by Kenny Blundell, Architect at ReachOut, 20 June 2020</h6>
                        <p class="card-text">As we come ever closer to the final release of our reachout application on June 28th, there’s a team wide sense of urgency and stress. We’ve delivered a hack that works and an MVP that we’ve been told could have possible real life value and genuinely help those in need during these difficult times. Whilst Coronavirus is slipping out of the media’s eye to focus on social matters that affect us all, it by no means has stopped affecting people. The team is working hard to deliver our 1.0 release after some intense improvements to existing portions of the system and additional enhancements that improve and refine the experience, we can safely say we’ve never worked harder.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">We’ve added groups, so you can build a rapport within your local area and self-admin and verify created services and requests, and of course build a social profile with others within your area, and build a community that transcends the social distancing measures making interaction that bit more difficult. We’ve also included Google maps API integration, and distance based searches based on your provided location so that you can ensure you are providing and receiving services within a local area. Nobody wants a medicine delivery to take two days because of accidentally accepting an offer from a fellow up in Aberdeen when you’re cosying up in Cornwall.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">We hope that you enjoy all the new updates so far. If you have any comments or suggestions, please email us at reachoutapplication20@gmail.com</p>

                        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Posted by Jordan Bamford, Software Developer at ReachOut, 14 May 2020</h6>
                        <p class="card-text">Today, we demonstrated as a group our Minimum Viable Product (or MVP, for short) to potential stakeholders of the ReachOut application.<p>
                        <p class="card-text">Whilst we had confidence in our own product and its value added, there was still that degree of uncertainty as to how it would be received by stakeholders. Whilst at it’s core the MVP's functionality was quite bare, we had concern that what we were showing may not be ‘enough’ to convince users of the value we could add. To our surprise, the MVP was received very well, with near unanimous praise. This inspired a new burst of confidence with the team, and we have new drive to deliver and enhance this application prior to our wide 1.0 release on June 28th.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">All the criticism received was highly constructive and was focused on how to improve what we already had, rather than tell us what base features we were missing. Suggestions such as facebook-style Groups are ones that we will be considering before final release, alongside smaller improvements to our existing functionality. We do have some surprises in store for the final release, and we will aim to have this live before the 28th of June. Spirits are high within the team, and we aim to keep this going strong through to the final release.</p>

                        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Posted by Jessica Morgan, Software Developer at ReachOut, 05 May 2020</h6>
                        <p class="card-text">Starting to develop an application from scratch is something that I'm sure most people would agree is quite a challenge. There are a lot of things you need to take into consideration, such as coding language, software, UI design, device compatibility and so much more. Our priority is to provide a secure, reliable, simple application that can provide value to it's users, especially during the ongoing pandemic.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">In March 2020 coronavirus had spread worldwide and many countries were starting to lockdown. We wanted to create an application to help people in this situation. These people may be vulnerable, sick, carers, key workers that can't risk going out in public and getting infected, or anyone else affected. We decided to create ReachOut.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The ReachOut team has worked together to decide which features our application should have. For our first release we were able to implement the signup, login, edit profile and services and requests system. We have all taken part in testing our live application and are happy that there are no bugs in this release.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">We are currently working on our second release which is going to be our minimum viable product. In this release we are going to include some changes to the web design, improved profile page displaying information of requests you have made. We will also be adding an in-app messaging service. This second release will be on the 14th May, after this we hope to release our app to the public so it can start being used to it's full potential.</p>
